# What I've done, am doing and thinking

![Google Assistant](https://img.shields.io/badge/google%20assistant-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=google%20assistant&logoColor=white)

Google Cast receiver for [TIDAL](https://tidal.com), including setting up possibilities to ingrate into the voice assistant.

![Bitcoin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bitcoin-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=bitcoin&logoColor=white)

Mined some Bitcoin in 2012 that I threw away through reformatting a disk. ðŸ™ƒ

![ClickHouse](https://img.shields.io/badge/ClickHouse-FFCC01?style=for-the-badge&logo=clickhouse&logoColor=white)

Self-hosting Plausible on my VPS for my own sites.

![Storybook](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Storybook-FF4785?style=for-the-badge&logo=storybook&logoColor=white)

Used Storybook at TIDAL, but we never really utilized it properly...

![CodePen](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codepen-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=codepen&logoColor=white)

I do have some pens on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/enjikaka), most are old with rather ugly code though.

![GitBook](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitBook-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitbook&logoColor=white)

For the old version of GitBook I made a [Google AdSense-plugin](https://github.com/Vufuzi/plugin-google-adsense).

![Wikipedia](https://img.shields.io/badge/Wikipedia-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=wikipedia&logoColor=white)

I occationally [contribute to WikiPedia](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anv%C3%A4ndare:Enjikaka).

![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/angular-%23DD0031.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white)

ðŸŽ¶ Directives set the stage in your HTML-page... ðŸŽ¶, I remember the song - but didn't really use the framework.

![Deno JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/deno%20js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=deno&logoColor=white)

Deno is my favourite flavour of server-side JavaScript. I've got several lambdas on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and also self-host Deno services on my VPS through [Dokku](https://dokku.com/).

![Esbuild](https://img.shields.io/badge/esbuild-%23FFCF00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=esbuild&logoColor=black)

I prefer to be outside the walled gardens of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and the like; so I turn to [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) in my own building pipelines.

![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

I've used it in the past, but with [URLPattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) and the awesome support for standards in Deno, I do not have to wander into Node.js for servers any more.

![Gulp](https://img.shields.io/badge/GULP-%23CF4647.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gulp&logoColor=white)

I, still, use Gulp for some building pipelines. It stands the test of time, unlike many other...

![Hugo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugo-black.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Hugo)

I've built some sites with and custom themes for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It was fun and fast.

![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

Used extensively through the years, but for new stuff I turn to [Deno](https://deno.com/).

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/redux-%23593d88.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redux&logoColor=white)

We refactored our Backbone.js app at TIDAL to React with Redux

![React Router](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=for-the-badge&logo=react-router&logoColor=white)

I single handedly refactorer the TIDAL web application from [redux-little-router](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/redux-little-router) to react-router in 2024. Had many "fun" merge conflicts on that one!

![RollupJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/RollupJS-ef3335?style=for-the-badge&logo=rollup.js&logoColor=white)

I've used Rollup several times to set up building pipelines for different projects.

![SASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/SASS-hotpink.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=SASS&logoColor=white)

I used the SCSS flavour of Sass a few years ago. Now I'm content using only modern CSS though PostCSS with preset-env though.

![Socket.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/Socket.io-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=socket.io&badgeColor=010101)

For fun I built a "listen together"-application than ran on top of TIDAL. This later evolved to the "Live" feature currently in production at TIDAL.

![Svelte](https://img.shields.io/badge/svelte-%23f1413d.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=svelte&logoColor=white)

Tried it a little. Special, a bit quirky. I think I prefer writing web components on my own instead.

![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

I prefer to learn and write CSS rather than making a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) in HTML-attributes...

![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/vite-%23646CFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vite&logoColor=white)

Great tool for building modern framework-based applications, and sometimes for library authoring. Falls short when you want to use modern browser features like dynamically loading CSS for web components though. I've used it to build the [TIDAL SDK for Web](https://github.com/tidal-music/tidal-sdk-web).

![Vue.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/vuejs-%2335495e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=%234FC08D)

One of my very first web apps, [Plypp](https://plypp.net/) - a piano application, is written in Vue! Enjoyed it. But if I made it today I would just use web components.

![Webpack](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-%238DD6F9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=webpack&logoColor=black)

Been using and disliking it at TIDAL. The documentation and upgrade paths often fall short, sadly.

![WordPress](https://img.shields.io/badge/WordPress-%23117AC9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=WordPress&logoColor=white)

I have very limited experience with WordPress, but have managed to craft themes a few times. I do believe they've found the worst way ever for templating.

![nVIDIA](https://img.shields.io/badge/nVIDIA-%2376B900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=nVIDIA&logoColor=white)

I've got a 4070 to try out local AI models and play games.

![Xbox](https://img.shields.io/badge/xbox-%23107C10.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=xbox&logoColor=white)

Rocking a Series X, and liking it.

![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-%23FF9900.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)

Deployed some lambdas here during my time at TIDAL. Have also fiddled a bit with S3.

![Datadog](https://img.shields.io/badge/datadog-%23632CA6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=datadog&logoColor=white)

We used Datadog at TIDAL.

![Github Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/github%20pages-121013?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)

Enjoy GitHub pages for smaller deployments and testing.

Used Sublime before but now I'm wuite comfortable in VS Code. I have also ported some themes to the editor.

![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

I'm often the person people ask when they need with CSS. I know it quite well!

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)

I've written some services in Go. One of them is in production at TIDAL; the OEmbed API.

![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)

In the world of modern JavaScript-frameworks the knowledge of proper nice semantic and accessible HTML often falls short. I try to keep it alive.

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

One of my first programming endeavours was Minecraft server plugins. Some of which I still maintain!

My top language and my bread and butter.

![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)

I've been in the game for so long that it has been hard to not touch PHP. My fathers website which I made still uses PHP.

I'm not coming back, sorry.

![Babel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Babel-F9DC3e?style=for-the-badge&logo=babel&logoColor=black)

Used a lot. I think it's sad that it enabled JSX though.

![Bitwarden](https://img.shields.io/badge/bitwarden-%23175DDC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bitwarden&logoColor=white)

I self-host Vaultwarden on a Raspberry Pi 5 at home, using [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) and [Tipi](https://runtipi.io/).

At TIDAL we use Prettier to format the code consistently.

Terraform is also in use at TIDAL, I did not spend much time fiddling with it though.

Used Cypress quite a lot at TIDAL for tests both locally and on CI.
